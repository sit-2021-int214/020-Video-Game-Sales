```
ใน dataset มี 271 Rows, 7 Columns ที่เป็นข้อมูลของ Computer Science/ Programming book ประกอบด้วย Rating, Reviews, Book_title, Description, Number_of_Pages, Type, Price

## Part 2: Learning function from Tidyverse

- Function `select()` from package [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#select-columns-with-select). It using for select columns

```
com_science %>% select(Rating,Book_title)
```
- Function `str_sort()` from package `stringr`. It returns the sorted vector.

```
str_sort(com_science$Rating)
```

Result:

```
> str_sort(com_science$Rating)
  [1] "3"    "3"    "3"    "3.2"  "3.22" "3.32" "3.33" "3.37" "3.38" "3.45" "3.48" "3.52" "3.56" "3.58" "3.58" "3.59" "3.6"

```
mean(com_science$Price)
com_science %>% select(Book_title,Price) %>% filter(Price == max(Price))
```

Result:

```
> mean(com_science$Price)
[1] 54.54186
> com_science %>% select(Book_title,Price) %>% filter(Price == max(Price))
                             Book_title  Price

หนังสือที่มี Rating ต่ำกว่า 4 มีทั้งหมด 92 เล่ม

3.มีหนังสือประเภทอะไรบ้าง และแต่ละประเภทมีหนังสือทั้งหมดกี่เล่ม

```
com_science %>% distinct(Type)
amount_book <- com_science %>% count(com_science$Type)
amount_book
```
